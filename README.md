# SnapMode: First Iranin Large-Scale Image Retrieval System 
- It presents a distributed stream processing platform for the real-time analysis of fashion data based on open-source big data analysis tools including Apache Storm, Apache Kafka, Apache Solr.
- It proposes a disentangled feature extraction method through a deep convolutional generative adversarial networks (DCGANs) for content-based image indexing and retrieval.
- It provides a solution to power embedding similarity search through the Milvus engine
